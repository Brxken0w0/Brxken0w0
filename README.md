- 👋 Hi, I’m @Brxken0w0
- 👀 I'm begginer in java programming. I study almost every day by making apps and games and i find it the best way for me to learn
- 🌱 I find learning code very chill and enjoyable, never get bored of it even if I have to code and try again and again just to make one thing in app to work
- 💞️ I have lot's of ideas for games and apps and I want to be able to make every idea come true
- 📫 Beside programming I self-study Chinese and i practice typing to be faster at it
